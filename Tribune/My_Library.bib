    note = {Presented at theFirst
              International Workshop on the Swarm at the Edge of
              the Cloud (SEC'13 @ ESWeek)},
    abstract = {In this talk, we will make the argument that
              interposing a "Universal Data Plane" (UDPlane)
              abstraction between components in Swarm
              applications provides a clean mechanism for
              constructing such applications. The UDPlane is a
              distributed entity that persists beneath the
              physical components of swarm applications. It
              provides location-independent naming for sources
              and sinks of data (called "Endpoints" for the
              remainder of this document). Endpoints are not
              permanently associated with IP addresses or other
              fixed routing addresses, but rather exist in a
              large flat namespace with sufficient identifiers
              (such as SHA-256 hashes). The basic abstraction is
              that of sending secure, immutable data
              "transactions" from a source Endpoint to one or
              more sink Endpoints. Transactions are time-stamped
              and (to the extent possible) securely associated
              with the source of the transaction via a
              signature. Sinks are specified by, among other
              things, their level of data persistence from
              transient to deep archival (years or decades).},

              data-centric glue for swarm applications. The
              basic primitive is that of a multi-input,
              multi-output, time-aware secure log. Data inputs
              are timestamped and rearranged by timestamp. Data
              can be securely committed to the log in a variety
              of ways, including via a external consistent
              transactional model. Data within the log can be
              randomly read, thereby permitting a variety of
              data models, including (eventually) a SQL query
              model. Further, data within a log can be preserved
